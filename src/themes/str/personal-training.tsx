    {
      question: 'What makes STR Personal Training different?',
      answer: 'STR Personal Training is assessment‑led and physiotherapy‑informed. Every program starts with a comprehensive evaluation of your movement, strength, and goals. Unlike generic training programs, your coach designs every session specifically for you, provides real‑time form correction, and adjusts your program based on your progress. You get undivided attention, evidence‑based coaching, and a program that evolves with you—not a one‑size‑fits‑all template.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the initial assessment work?',
      answer: 'Your first session is a comprehensive assessment where your coach evaluates your movement patterns, strength levels, mobility, and any limitations or injuries. We discuss your goals, training history, and lifestyle factors. This foundation allows us to design a program that\'s perfectly tailored to your body and objectives. The assessment typically takes 60‑90 minutes and includes movement screening, strength testing, and goal setting.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I expect in my first 1‑on‑1 session?',
      answer: 'After your initial assessment, your first training session introduces you to your personalized program. Your coach guides you through each exercise with real‑time form correction, explains the purpose of each movement, and ensures you\'re comfortable with the training approach. You\'ll learn proper technique, understand how the program addresses your goals, and experience the level of attention and coaching you\'ll receive in every session.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I do personal training?',
      answer: 'Training frequency depends on your goals, experience level, schedule, and budget. Most clients train 2‑3 times per week for optimal results, though some train more frequently for specific goals like competition prep or injury rehabilitation. During your initial consultation, your coach will recommend a training frequency that balances your goals with your lifestyle and ensures sustainable progress.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can personal training help with injury recovery?',
      answer: 'Yes. Our physiotherapy‑informed approach means your coach understands how to work with injuries safely and effectively. Your program incorporates rehabilitation principles, movement corrections, and progressive loading that supports your body\'s healing process. We work closely with physiotherapists when needed and design training that addresses your injury while building strength and function. Many clients come to us specifically for post‑injury training.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What results can I expect from personal training?',
      answer: 'Results depend on your goals, consistency, and commitment, but most clients see measurable improvements within 4‑6 weeks. You can expect increased strength, improved movement quality, better body composition, enhanced performance, and reduced injury risk. Our evidence‑based approach focuses on sustainable, long‑term improvements rather than quick fixes. Your coach tracks your progress and adjusts your program to ensure you\'re always moving toward your goals.',
