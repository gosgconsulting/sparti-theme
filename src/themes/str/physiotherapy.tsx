      question: 'How long does a physiotherapy session last?',
      answer: 'Initial assessments typically last 60-90 minutes to allow for comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning.

      answer: 'The number of sessions varies depending on your condition, its severity, how long you\'ve had it, and your goals. Some acute injuries may resolve in 4-6 sessions, while chronic conditions or post-surgical rehabilitation may require more extended treatment. Your physiotherapist will provide an estimated treatment timeline after your initial assessment, and we\'ll regularly reassess your progress to ensure you\'re on track. We focus on getting you better as efficiently as possible while ensuring long-term results.',

We\'ll evaluate your movement, strength, range of motion, and functional limitations. Based on this assessment, we\'ll explain our findings, discuss your treatment plan, and begin treatment. You\'ll receive education about your condition and may be given exercises to start at home. We\'ll also discuss expected outcomes and treatment timeline.
